Orbital Smasher

Style:
    Space
    Frenzy
    
UI:
    Try and use only the mouse/buttons

Core mechanic:
    Flying planetoids which collect other flying planetoids
    Use movement to make detritus spin
    Fling or smash detritus into other planetoids to reduce health
    Detritus can absorb gunfire, shoot things, make things catch on fire, 
    ...are radioactive (hurts user), etc.

Architecture:
    Entities possess components. 
    Different "processors" filter through entities and apply an operation if they contain a 
    ...given component.
    Components are IDs, not objects or executables.
    Component IDS can contain specifiers.
    Flow:
        Processors handle input, output, physics.
        Processors will iterate through all entities to update their data
        Entities contain a list of components, and a dict which processors can attach data to
