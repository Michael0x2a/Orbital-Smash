# Readme: Orbital Smash

## Background

This is a physics-based game written in Python and Pygame. 
It was designed, coded, and tested in 24 hours during the [Seattle CodeDay][1], a local hackathon.
It won the "Best Game" award!


## About

The purpose of this game is to smash enemy starships to rack up points, and survive as long as
you can without being smashed yourself.

Move around using the mouse.

Hold the left or right mouse button to activate a tractor beam and make the nearest object 
orbit around you.

By moving around, and holding an object, you can use it as a sort of hammer to smash enemies,
or fling objects as a projectile by transferring force and momentum.

Destroy all enemies to advance to the next wave!
